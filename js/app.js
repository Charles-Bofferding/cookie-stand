//Shop Setup
// Within your javascript file (example: app.js), create separate JS object literals for each shop location that outputs the following to the sales.html file:

// Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties
// All stores go 6 am to 8 pm
// Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random
// Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated
// Store the results for each location in a separate arrayâ€¦ perhaps as a property of the object representing that location
// Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser
// Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:

// Seattle

// 6am: 16 cookies
// 7am: 20 cookies
// 8am: 35 cookies
// 9am: 48 cookies
// 10am: 56 cookies
// 11am: 77 cookies
// 12pm: 93 cookies
// 1pm: 144 cookies
// 2pm: 119 cookies
// 3pm: 84 cookies
// 4pm: 61 cookies
// 5pm: 23 cookies
// 6pm: 42 cookies
// 7pm: 57 cookies
// Total: 875 cookies
