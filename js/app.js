//Shop Setup
// Within your javascript file (example: app.js), create separate JS object literals for each shop location that outputs the following to the sales.html file:

// Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties
// All stores go 6 am to 8 pm
// Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random
// Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated
// Store the results for each location in a separate arrayâ€¦ perhaps as a property of the object representing that location
// Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser
// Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:
